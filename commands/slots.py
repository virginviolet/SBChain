    Command to play a slot machine.

    If it's the first time the user plays, they will be offered a
    starting bonus of an amount that is decided by a die.

    Three blank emojis are displayed and then the reels will stop in a few
    seconds, or the user can stop them manually by hitting the stop buttons that
    appear. The message containing the blank emojis are updated each time a reel
    is stopped.
    If they get a net positive outcome, the amount will be added to their
    balance. If they get a net negative outcome, the loss amount will be
    transferred to the casino's account.
